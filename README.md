# bitbox
The project is to implement BitBox Peer to form an unstructured P2P network. 
The essential components are the File System Manager, which is already implemented, that monitors the shared directory in the file system on a local machine, for changes to files and directories, and a BitBox Peer that can send messages of these changes to another BitBox Peer on a remote machine.
